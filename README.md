1. [HMM for POS Tagging using Viterbi Algorithm](https://github.com/jatinlakhani1234/NLP/blob/main/HMM%20for%20POS%20Tagging%20using%20Viterbi%20Algorithm.ipynb) : Implemented an algorithm similar as Viterbi Algorithm for the purpose of PoS tagging. Used a tag data to form transition and emission matrices, later used them in Hidden Markov Model for the purpose of tagging.

2. [Book Analysis](https://github.com/jatinlakhani1234/NLP/blob/main/Two_book_Analysis.ipynb) : I have analyzed 2 books taken from "http://www.gutenberg.org". The task included steps such as Removing Special Characters, Removing unnecessary text, Tokenization, POS Tagging, Wordcloud, Named Entity Recognition, and Named Entity Relationship.
